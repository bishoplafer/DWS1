		<div id="artElements">
			<h1 id="subTitle">Art Elements</h1>
			<p>Design elements are the basic units of a painting, drawing, design or other visual piece and include:</p>
			<h2>Line</h2>
			<p>A line is a fundamental mark or stroke used in drawing in which the length is longer than the width. Two connected points form a line and every line has a length, width, and direction if it is straight. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>A line that defines or bounds an edge, but not always the outside edge, could represent a fold or color change.</li>
				<li>A line that defines the edge of space can also be created by a gap of negative space. Many uses include to separate columns, rows of type, or to show a change in document type.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lines are used in linear shapes and patterns to decorate many different substrates, and can be used to create shadows representing tonal value, called hatching.</p>
			<h2>Color</h2>
			<p>Color can play a large role in the elements of design with the color wheel being used as a tool, and color theory providing a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual impacts of specific color combination.</p>
			<h3>Uses</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Color can aid organization so develop a color strategy and stay consistent with those colors.</li>
				<li>It can give emphasis to create a hierarchy</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Attributes</h3>
			<h4>Hue</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Values and tints and shades of colors that are created by adding black to a color for a shade and white for a tint. Creating a tint or shade of a color reduces the saturation.</li>
				<li>Saturation gives a color brightness or dullness.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Shape</h2>
			<p>A shape is defined as an area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture. All objects are composed of shapes and all other 'Elements of Design' are shapes in some way.</p>
			<h3>Categories</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Mechanical Shapes</strong> or <strong>Geometric Shapes</strong> are the shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass. Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control or order.</li>
			<li><strong>Organic Shapes</strong> are freehand drawn shapes that are complex and normally found in nature. Organic shapes produce a natural feel.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Texture</h2>
			<p>Meaning the way a surface feels or is perceived to feel. Texture can be added to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on the pleasantness of the texture.</p>
			<h3>Types of texture</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Tactile texture</strong> is the actual three-dimension feel of a surface that can be touched. Painter can use impasto to build peaks and create texture.</li>
			<li><strong>Visual texture</strong> is the illusion of the surfaces peaks and valleys, like the tree pictured. Any texture shown in a photo is a visual texture, meaning the paper is smooth no matter how rough the image perceives it to be.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most textures have a natural feel but still seem to repeat a motif in some way. Regularly repeating a motif will result in a texture appearing as a pattern.</p>
			<h2>Space</h2>
			<p>In design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Overlap</strong> is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.</li>
				<li><strong>Shading</strong> adds gradation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.</li>
				<li><strong>Highlight</strong>, <strong>Transitional Light</strong>, <strong>Core of the Shadow</strong>, <strong>Reflected Light</strong>, and <strong>Cast Shadow</strong> give an object a three-dimensional look.</li>
				<li><strong>Linear Perspective</strong> is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.</li>
				<li><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong> is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distance objects.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Form</h2>
			<p>Form is any three dimensional object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. There are two types of form, geometric (man-made) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture and color. It can be illustrated or constructed.</p>

			<h1>Principles of Design</h1>
			<p>Principles applied to the elements of design that bring them together into one design. How one applies these principles determines how successful a design may be.</p>
			<h2>Unity/Harmony</h2>
			<p>According to Alex White, author of The Elements of Graphic Design, to achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design. A good balance between unity and variety must be established to avoid a chaotic or a lifeless design.</p>
			<h3>Methods</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Proximity</li>
				<li>Similarity</li>
				<li>Continuation</li>
				<li>Repetition</li>
				<li>Rhythm is achieved when recurring position, size, color, and use of a graphic element has a focal point interruption.</li>
				<li>Altering the basic theme achieves unity and helps keep interest.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Balance</h2>
			<p>It is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.</p>
			<h3>Types</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Symmetry</li>
				<li>Asymmetrical produces an informal balance that is attention attracting and dynamic.</li>
				<li>Radial balance is arranged around a central element. The elements placed in a radial balance seem to 'radiate' out from a central point in a circular fashion.</li>
				<li>Overall is a mosaic form of balance which normally arises from too many elements being put on a page. Due to the lack of hierarchy and contrast, this form of balance can look noisy.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
			<p>A good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least.</p>
			<h2>Scale/proportion</h2>
			<p>Using the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point. When elements are designed larger than life, scale is being used to show drama.</p>
			<h2>Dominance/emphasis</h2>
			<p>Dominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape. The focal point should dominate the design with scale and contrast without sacrificing the unity of the whole.</p>
			<h2>Similarity and contrast</h2>
			<p>Planning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designers work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.</p>
			<h2>Similar environment</h2>
			<p>There are several ways to develop a similar environment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Build a unique internal organization structure.</li>
				<li>Manipulate shapes of images and text to correlate together.</li>
				<li>Express continuity from page to page in publications. Items to watch include headers, themes, borders, and spaces.</li>
				<li>Develop a style manual and stick with the format.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Movement is the path the viewerâ€™s eye takes through the artwork, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines edges, shape and color within the artwork.</p>
