		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
		<p>The <strong>giant squid (genus: <em>Architeuthis</em>)</strong> is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <strong><em>Architeuthidae</em></strong>, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see <em>Deep-sea gigantism</em>): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the <em>colossal squid</em> at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms). The <em>mantle</em> is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
		<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science"><strong>NMNS</strong></abbr> (Museum of Nature and Science) of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association"><strong>OWA</strong></abbr> (Ogasawara Whale Watching Association) took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science"><strong>NMNS</strong></abbr> and <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association"><strong>OWA</strong></abbr> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
