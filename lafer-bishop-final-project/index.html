		<h2>Taoism at a glance</h2>	
		<p>Taoism is an <strong>ancient tradition</strong> of philosophy and religious belief that is deeply rooted in Chinese customs and worldview.</p>
		<p>Taoism is also referred to as Daoism, which is a more accurate way of representing in English the sound of the Chinese word.</p>
		<p>Taoism is about <strong>the Tao</strong>. This is usually translated as <em>the Way</em>. But it's hard to say exactly what this means. The Tao is the ultimate creative principle of the universe. All things are unified and connected in the Tao.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Taoism originated in China 2000 years ago</li>
			<li>It is a religion of unity and opposites; <strong>Yin and Yang</strong>. The principle of Yin Yang sees the world as filled with complementary forces - action and non-action, light and dark, hot and cold, and so on</li>
			<li>The Tao is not <strong>God</strong> and is not worshipped. Taoism includes many <strong>deities</strong>, that are <strong>worshipped</strong> in Taoist temples, they are part of the universe and depend, like everything, on the Tao</li>
			<li>Taoism promotes: 
				<ul><li>achieving harmony or union with nature</li>
				<li><strong>the pursuit of spiritual immortality</strong></li> 
				<li>being 'virtuous' (but not ostentatiously so)</li>
				<li>self-development</li>
				</ul> 
			</li>
			<li>Taoist practices include:
				<ul><li>meditation</li>
				<li>feng shui</li> 
				<li>fortune telling</li> 
				<li><strong>reading and chanting of scriptures</strong></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Before the Communist revolution fifty years ago, Taoism was one of the strongest religions in China. After a campaign to destroy non-Communist religion, however, the numbers significantly reduced, and it has become difficult to assess the statistical popularity of Taoism in the world.</p>
		<p>The 2001 census recorded 3,500 Taoists in England and Wales.</p>

		<h2>The Tao is not a thing</h2>
		<p>The Tao is not a thing or a substance in the conventional sense.</p>
		<p>It cannot be perceived but it can be observed in the things of the world. Although it gives rise to all being, it does not itself have being.</p>
		<p>Although it's conventional to refer to The Tao, some writers think that the "the" should be dropped because it isn't in the original Chinese term.</p>
		<p>They feel that using 'the' gives Westerners the idea that the Tao is a metaphysical reality, by which they mean a thing (in the widest sense) or an absolute being like a <strong>god</strong>.</p>
		<p>But even the name Tao can lead Westerners to think of Tao in the same way that they think of objects.</p>
		<p>That sort of thinking is misleading: Thinking of the Tao as some sort of object produces an understanding of the Tao that is less than the reality.</p>
		<p>It might be more helpful to regard Tao as a <strong>system of guidance</strong>. And if one does this one can translate 'achieving union with the Tao' into 'developing oneself so as to live in complete conformity with the teachings of the Tao' which is easier to understand, and closer to the truth.</p>
		<h3>Glimpsed only through its effects</h3>
		<p>A good way of avoiding the Tao-as-object error is to see the various concepts of the Tao as doing no more than describing those effects of the Tao that human beings are aware of. They do not describe its reality.</p>
		<h3>The Tao is not God</h3>
		<p>The Tao is not God and is not worshipped. Taoism does include <strong>many deities</strong>, but although these are worshipped in Taoist temples, they are part of the universe and depend, like everything, on the Tao.</p>
		<p>The Tao includes several <strong>concepts</strong> in one word:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>the source of creation</li>
			<li>the ultimate</li>
			<li>the inexpressible and indefinable</li>
			<li>the unnameable</li>
			<li>the natural universe as a whole</li>
			<li>the way of nature as a whole</li>
		</ol>
